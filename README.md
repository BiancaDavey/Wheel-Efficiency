# Hamster

This program simulates a wheel and provides methods for calculating the efficiency and charge for a given sequence of three values input by the user and handled as a char array.

## Features

* User can input unique combinations of three values to be calculated.
* Values representing feed, motivation and hydration stored and handled in a char array for calculation.
* Algorithm used to calculate efficiency, charge and total count of the sequence input.

## Installation

Java is required to run this program.

## Usage

1. Compile the program class with the command `Wheel.java`. 
2. Compile the demonstration class with the command `WheelDemo.java`.
3. Run the program with the command `java WheelDemo`.
4. Input char values for each cycle by pressing the `f`, `h` or `m` key when prompted. 
5. Press the `Enter` key to input a value for the next cycle. 
6. After values for 20 cycles are input, the program will output the efficiency and charge reached by the sequence.

## Usage Example

```
javac Wheel.java
javac WheelDemo.java
java WheelDemo
```
